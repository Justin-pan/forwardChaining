# Forward Chaining Fun

Just a straightforward forward chaining program that takes in a file with rules and derives literals from those rules

## The Input Format

This takes an input text file where the rules are formatted '[x [y z] [a b]]' where the first literal is the head of the rule, the first bracketed set contains the set of positive literals in the body of the rule, and the second bracketed set contains the set of negative literals in the body of the rule.
